# Cybernetics

You can't just implant a cybernetic device into a person and expect them to be able to use it effectively.  Cybernetics are by definition 'alien' to the body, and so it takes time and patience to adjust to, and use them effectively.  In addition, cybernetics take a psychological toll on the user. 

## Cybernetic Threshold and Cybernetic Stress Value
The number of implants and attachments an individual can safely take is limited by their Cybernetic Threshold. Typically, a creature's Cybernetic Threshold is equal to their proficiency bonus plus their charisma bonus (minimum 1), though it is possible to have a higher or lower value for various reasons. Individual cybernetic enhancements have an Cybernetic Stress Value of 0, 1 or more, and a character that has an implant or attachment with an Stress Value of 1 or greater gains a Cybernetic Stress Value equal to that of all of their cybernetic enhancements combined.  All is well as long as a character's stress value is equal to or less than their cybernetic threshold.  

## Exceeding your Cybernetic Threshold
Creatures that have more implants than they can safely handle find themselves increasingly distracted, disoriented, and are at an increased risk of developing madness (see the section on Madness in CONTINUE).  Such characters suffer a penalty to all social skills, as well as saves against mental stress equal to their Stress Value minus their Cybernetic Threshold.  

Further, whenever a creature makes a save vs. mental stress, they must also make a second save vs. mental stress with a DC equal to 10+ their current Cybernetic Stress Value (note their penalty to saves vs. mental stress). A failure results in temporary madness (see the section on Madness).  A creature already suffering from temporary madness is at risk of developing permanent madness instead. If this save is failed, the creature instead gains an indefinite madness.

## Cybernetics and the Supernatural
Cybernetics interfere with magical or psionic abilities.  A creature that gains any Stress Value also loses the ability to attune to a number of magical items equal to that stress value (minimum 0).  In addition, cybernetics interfere with the ability to manifest powers and wield magic. A character reduces their available PPE and ISP by 10% x their Stress Value.

## Augment Types and Locations
A character can get one of three different types of augmentations: sensory implants, limb replacements, and body enhancements. Sensory implants are typically implanted in the head, and typically enhance the character's senses. Typically, a character can have up to 6 sensory enhancements: one for each eye, one for the ears, one for the sinuses, and 3 brain interfaces. Limb replacements are exactly what they sound like: they are cybernetic replacements of a character's limbs. A character can have as many as 4 limb replacements: one for each limb. Body enhancements cover all other kinds of implants, and a character is limited only by the Cybernetic Threshold. 

## Learning to use your cybernetics
Once a creature has healed from surgery (see below), they can begin to learn how to use their new cybernetic enhancements. If they have not exceeded their Cybernetic Threshold, learning to use their new attachments can be done during a single short rest. If the character has exceeded their Threshold, they must make a charisma save (DC 10 + their total Stress Value) in order to learn to use their new cybernetics. Failure on this save means that they cannot use any new enhancements, and they must wait until after a long rest in order to try again. Any character that begins play with cybernetic enhancements is assumed to have gone through this process and can use their enhancements normally (even if they begin play exceeding their Cybernetic Threshold). 

## Cyber Surgery
Cybernetics are installed via a cyber surgery kit, or, in an emergency, a surgery kit. The DC to install an enhancement is dependent on the enhancement in question, but use of a regular surgery kit increases the DC by 5. 

### Recovery
If the installation is a success, characters take on a number of levels of exhaustion equal to the total Stress Value of all newly implanted cybernetics (minimum 1). Further, the character's maximum hp total is reduced by 10 (-Con Modifier) for each point of Stress value of the newly installed cybernetic devices (minimum 10 - con modifier). At the end of each day of total rest, they must make a constitution save against a DC of 15 + the total stress value of all implanted cybernetics (again, minimum of 1).  If they succeed, their level of exhaustion is reduced by 1, and their maximum hit point total recovers by 10 - con modifier. Once their exhaustion level has reached zero, they can begin to adjust to their implants, learning how to use them effectively (see above). A creature does not gain any benefit from any enhancements until they have fully healed from surgery. 

On a failure, the cybernetic enhancements have not been properly installed. A character must make a constitution save vs. shock (DC 15+ the total stress value of all implanted cybernetics minimum of 1)) or lose consciousness and immediately begin dying. Make death saving throws normally. On a successful save (or upon recovering from a failed save), the creature also gains exhaustion levels equal to the the total Stress Value of all newly implanted cybernetic devices (minimum 1) and can recover as above.  However, they cannot use any of the new cybernetic devices until another try is made. 

## Repair and Maintenance
Cybernetic devices degrade over time if not upkeep. In addition, cybernetic components can break and become non-functional, especially if a character takes a significant amount of damage.

### Breakage
An implant can break under the following conditions:
- Dropping to 0 hit points: Whenever a character drops to 0 hit points, they must make a Constitution save equal to 10 + their total Stress Value for each cybernetic implant they have. For each failure, the device in question has been damaged and rendered inoperable (see below).  
- Taking Massive Damage: A character that takes massive damage must make a constitution save for each device with a DC equal to 10 + their total Stress Value. A failed save means that the device in question has been damaged and rendered inoperable (see below).  If the character fails their save against massive damage, they automatically fail all of these saves and so all of their cybernetic devices are damaged and inoperable. 
- Sacrificing a limb: You can intentionally use a cybernetic limb CONTINUE. 

#### A broken device
When a cybernetic device is broken, the creature cannot make use it until it is repaired (see below). In addition, the character gains a level of exhaustion for each broken device which cannot be recovered until the device is repaired, replaced, or removed. Note that removal can have effects of it's own (for example, blindness). 

### Maintenance
Most characters make a point of learning how to maintain their cybernetic devices. As long as a character has access to a Cybernetics Repair Kit, they can be assumed to have completed whatever maintenance is required to upkeep their cybernetic devices. A character can also pay 10 credits per Stress Value of their implants (minimum 10 credits) to have their cybernetics maintained at a shop.  Maintenance must be performed once per month.  Failure to perform maintenance makes a character vulnerable to breakdown. Each time a character uses a cybernetic device that has not been properly maintained, they must make a Constitution save with a DC = 10 + total Stress Value of all cybernetics (minimum 1) + 2/each month their devices have not been properly maintained. Failure on this save means that the device fails to work and must be repaired (see above). 

### Repairing a device
Repairing a broken cybernetic device requires a cybernetics repair kit.  The DC to repair the device is outlined in the description of the device itself (see individual device descriptions).

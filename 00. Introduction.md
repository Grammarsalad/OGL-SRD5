# 0.0 What is Old School Pulp Cthulhu?

## What is Pulp Cthulhu 
Pulp Cthulhu, as I define it, is characterized by Cthulhuesque themes with high fantasy characteristics.  Reality as we know it is an illusion, a pocket of sanity in a universe given to unfathomable chaos, nihilism, and entropy.  The 'gods', such as they are, are either non-existent, malevolent or blind primal forces, or, perhaps, a manifestation of popular belief.  This illusion serves as a kind of protective, however, as knowledge of the truth of reality strains, and often breaks, the mind.  Most people do not want to know the truth, and actively work to suppress it.  The reasons why they do this are myriad, but it is often a subconscious defense mechanism designed to protect their sanity.  

The heroes of the story, on the other hand, are a cut above the rest. They know or have better insight into the true nature of reality, and they have better defenses against the terrors that hide just beneath the veneer.  

## What is Old School Role-Playing? 
In this context, an 'old school' RPG is any rpg that tries to capture the secret mix found in the original versions of the first and finest rpg.  This game makes heavy use of the ogl rules found in the 5th edition, but makes changes in order to recapture the best of both worlds.

### Abilities

Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:

- **Strength**, measuring physical power
- **Dexterity**, measuring agility
- **Constitution**, measuring endurance
- **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory
- **Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight
- **Charisma**, measuring force of personality

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature's assets as well as weaknesses.

The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. 

More detail can be found in section 1.1 Rolling Ability Scores.  CONTINUE LINK!


### Saving Throws
A saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don't normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character is at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. Each saving throw is associated with a particular cluster of effects, and an attribute that modifies that save.  

The types of saves, and the attributes that modify them, are as follows:

- **Brute Force (Strength)**: Use this saving throw to resist brute force effects that would move or restrain you. Modified by Strength. 
- **Death, Poison, or Disease (Constitution)**: The saving throw against attacks that severely test fortitude. Modified by Constitution.   
- **Paralysis, Petrify, or Polymorph (Constitution)**: The saving throw against restrictions on movement and transformations. Modified by Constitution. 
- **Wands, Devices, or Traps (Dexterity)**: The saving throw against sudden or aimed attacks that need to be dodged. Modified by Dexterity.
- **Blast, or Breath (Dexterity)**: The saving throw against area, cloud, and cone attacks that must be dodged. Modified by Dexterity.
- **Illusions (Intelligence)**: The saving throw against attacks that test perception. Modified by Intelligence. 
- **Enchantment (Wisdom)**: The saving throw against attacks the mind directly, including manipulative and most mind-affecting spells. Modified by Wisdom. 
- **Fear, or Mind Control (Charisma)**: The saving throw against attacks that test willpower, such as terrifying and sanity-blasting situations and spells that overtake or control the mind. Modified by Charisma. 


A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Enchantment and Mind Control saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to the relevant saving throws. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is typically determined by the caster's spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.

# 1.1 Rolling Ability Scores

## ABILITIES
Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:

- **Strength**, measuring physical power
- **Dexterity**, measuring agility
- **Constitution**, measuring endurance
- **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory
- **Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight
- **Charisma**, measuring force of personality

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature's assets as well as weaknesses.

The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The book's introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.

## Ability Scores and Modifiers

Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. 

A score of 9, 10, or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and greater beings can have scores as high as 30.

## Using Each Ability

Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.

### Strength

Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.


**Table: Strength Modifiers**

| Score  | Modifier | EV |   
|:-----|:----:|:----:|
| 3 |-3 | ^ |
| 4 |-2 | ^ |
| 5 |-2 |+5 |
| 6 |-1 |+6 |
| 7 |-1 |+7|
| 8 |-1 |+8 |
| 9 |0 |+9 |
| 10 |0 |+10 |
| 11 |0 |+11 |
| 12 |+1 |+12 |
| 13 |+1 |+13 |
| 14 |+1 |+14 |
| 15 |+2 |+15 |
| 16 |+2 |+16 |
| 17 |+3 |+17 |
| 18 |+3 |+18 |
| 19 |+4 |+19 |
| 20 |+4 |+20 |
| 21 |+5 |+21 |
| 22 |+6 |+22 |
| 23 |+7 |+23 |
| 24 |+8 |+24 |
| 25 |+10 |+25 |
| 26 |+11 |+26 |
| 27 |+12 |+27 |
| 28 |+14 |+28 |
| 29 |+15 |+29 |
| 30 |+16 |+30 |

**Score**: This is the numerical representation of your strength.
**Modifier**: This is the value added (or subtracted) to attempts at performing feats of strength, melee and thrown attack and damage rolls, and strength based skills and saving throws. 
**EV**: EV stands for Encumbrance Value. Strength strongly modifies how much equipment a character can lug around. Strength values with a caret (^) can only carry up to their strength value in EV before becoming heavily encumbered, and even then they are considered moderately encumbered. They are only unencumbered when weighed down by no gear. In this case, constitution modifiers are ignored.

#### Feats of Strength

Also called a Strength check, a feat of strength covers any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. A strength check is modified by the strength modifier column above.  

The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
- Break free of bonds
- Push through a tunnel that is too small
- Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it
- Tip over a statue
- Keep a boulder from rolling

#### Attack Rolls and Damage

You add your character's Strength modifier to attack rolls and your damage rolls when attacking with a non-finesse weapon, which includes most melee weapons and some ranged weapons.

#### Encumbrance
Your character's Strength (and, to a lesser degree, constitution) score determines how much weight may be carried by your character. See the Encumbrance section CONTINUE for details on the effects of weight carried upon a character's movement and actions.

#### Saving Throws

Strength modifies the following saving throws (see section CONTINUE for more details): 
- Brute Force


#### Skill Rolls

Strength modifies the following skills (see section CONTINUE for more details): 
- Athletics 
- Blacksmithing
- Carpentry

# Introduction
## What is Pulp Cthulhu 
Pulp Cthulhu, as I define it, is characterized by Cthulhuesque themes with high fantasy characteristics.  Reality as we know it is an illusion, a pocket of sanity in a universe given to unfathomable chaos, nihilism, and entropy.  The 'gods', such as they are, are either non-existent, malevolent or blind primal forces, or, perhaps, a manifestation of popular belief.  This illusion serves as a kind of protective, however, as knowledge of the truth of reality strains, and often breaks, the mind.  Most people do not want to know the truth, and actively work to suppress it.  The reasons why they do this are myriad, but it is often a subconscious defense mechanism designed to protect their sanity.  

The heroes of the story, on the other hand, are a cut above the rest. They know or have better insight into the true nature of reality, and they have better defenses against the terrors that hide just beneath the veneer.  

## What is Old School Role-Playing? 
In this context, an 'old school' RPG is any rpg that tries to capture the secret mix found in the original versions of the first and finest rpg.  This game makes heavy use of the ogl rules found in the 5th edition, but makes changes in order to recapture the best of both worlds.  

## Game Terms

### Saving Throws
A saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don't normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character is at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. Each saving throw is associated with a particular cluster of effects, and an attribute that modifies that save.  

The types of saves, and the attributes that modify them, are as follows:

- **Paralysis, Poison, and Disease (Constitution)**: Poison and disease include any effect that CONTINUE.  Paralysis includes any effect that negatively impacts the creature's    nevrous system (often, but not always, due to a poison).  
- **Death (Constitution)**: Death effects include any necromantic effect that drains the lifeforce from it's victims or kills them outright. 
- **Transformation (Constitution)**: Transformation effects change the physical (and often mental) form of the target.
- **Rays, and Blasts (Dexterity)**: Rays, and Blasts include any effect that must be dodged to be avoided.  Many, but not all, traps fall into this category.
- **Enchantment (Wisdom)**: Enchantment effects influence the mind without actually controling or suppressing it (almost always due to some magic or supernatural influence).  
- **Mind Control (Charisma)**: Mind control effects seek to suppress or control the mind of their targets. 


A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Enchantment and Mind Control saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to the relevant saving throws. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is typically determined by the caster's spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.

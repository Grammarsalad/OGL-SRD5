# 0.0 What is Old School Pulp Cthulhu?

## What is Pulp Cthulhu 
Pulp Cthulhu, as I define it, is characterized by Cthulhuesque themes with high fantasy characteristics.  Reality as we know it is an illusion, a pocket of sanity in a universe given to unfathomable chaos, nihilism, and entropy.  The 'gods', such as they are, are either non-existent, malevolent or blind primal forces, or, perhaps, a manifestation of popular belief.  This illusion serves as a kind of protective, however, as knowledge of the truth of reality strains, and often breaks, the mind.  Most people do not want to know the truth, and actively work to suppress it.  The reasons why they do this are myriad, but it is often a subconscious defense mechanism designed to protect their sanity.  

The heroes of the story, on the other hand, are a cut above the rest. They know or have better insight into the true nature of reality, and they have better defenses against the terrors that hide just beneath the veneer.  

## What is Old School Role-Playing? 
In this context, an 'old school' RPG is any rpg that tries to capture the secret mix found in the original versions of the first and finest rpg.  This game makes heavy use of the ogl rules found in the 5th edition, but makes changes in order to recapture the old school feel.  

# 0.1 Game Basics

Virtually all actions require a die roll, or die rolls, to determine success, or failure.  There are, essentially, five kinds of rolls: combat checks, casting checks, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks.  

## Combat Checks
Combat rolls always use a d20, and success typically requires beating the opponent's Armor Class. Combat rolls can be modified by the character's Attributes, Proficiency Bonus, Feats, and Misclaneous Modifiers (see below).

**Opposed Combat Checks**: Whenever there is an opposed combat check, both characters roll a d20 and add all relevant modifiers.  The character with the higher result wins the contest.  In an instance of a tie, the defending character wins.  For instance, Borgar is trying to disarm Sasha.  Both roll and get a result of 15.  Because Sasha is the defender in this instance, she wins the contest and is not disarmed.

## Saving Thows

## Skill Checks
Skill checks are resolved by rolling 2d6 and comparing the result to difficulty class (DC) rating determined by the difficulty or complexity of the task--typically the DC is 8 or 11, but it can be higher or lower at the DM's descretion. Skill checks are modified by the character's Attributes, Background, Class abilities, Racial abilities, skill Ranks, Feats, or Miscellaneous Modifiers. 

Wherever the DM calls for a check, the player rolls 2d6, adds modifiers, and compares the result with the DC. If the check is equal to or above the DC, the check succeeds.  If it is below the DC, the check fails. 

 ##### Action Check Guidelines
| Challenge | DC | Example |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| Easy  | 5 | Notice something in plain sight|
| Average  | 8 | Repair a broken door-latch |
| Tough | 11 | Push a boulder hanging precariously over a cliff |
| Heroic | 13 | Open a legendary lock made by a legendary dwarven smith | 
| Impossible | 15 | Move a goddess of the arts to tears with your song |

## Ability Checks
Ability checks work exactly like skill checks, exept that they are affected by fewer modifiers. Specifically, they are only affected by Attribute Modifiers, Feats, and Miscelaneous bonuses. Any bonus that applies to an ability check also applies to a skill check that makes use of that same abilty. 




**Opposed Skill & Ability Checks**: Wherever there is an opposed check, both characters roll 2d6 and add all relevant modifiers and compare them. The character with the higher rolls wins the contest.  Where the result is a tie, either the result is a stalemate or the  rolls the appropriate die and subtracts the opposed skill value from their proficiency value. For instance, a player with a perception value of 8 trying to detect a hidden opponent with a stealth of 3 in a dark and stormy night would roll a d20 (for the difficult conditions) and subtract 3 from their value of 8 meaning that they succeed on a roll of 5 or less.

The following chart outlines the typical die one needs to roll given the difficulty of a given check. Note that the DM can decide to allow an automatic success for a routine or easy challenge (though, the player can still roll if they hope to achieve a critical success--see Critical Success and Failure below).  

 ##### Action Check Guidelines
| Challenge | Die | Example |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| Routine  | d4| Notice something in plain sight|
| Easy  | d6 - d8 | Repair a broken door-latch |
| Average | d10 - d12 | Climb a tree |
| Tough | d14-d16 | Guide your ship safely through a raging storm | 
| Challenging | d20 | Leap onto the back of a giant eagle as it swoops past you |
| Formidable | d24 | Open a legendary lock made by a legendary dwarven smith |
| Heroic | d30 | Move a goddess of the arts to tears with your song |

### Critical Success and Failure  
A character that beats the die roll by 5 generally qualifies as a critical success, while a check that fails the roll by 5 is a critical failure.  So, for example, a character with a strength modifier of 6, if they roll a 1 on a check to break open a door, they get a critical success.  So, for example, the DM might rule that the door crushes a goblin listening on the other side of the door.  On the other hand, if they were to roll an 11, they might hurt themselves (taking an amount of damage determined by the DM).  

#### Critical Success
A critical success means different things depending on the check.  A weapon attack that is critically successful, for instance, typically does double damage (see the equipment section for details).  The DM determines exactly what happens on most occasions. 

#### Critical Failure
The effects of critical failure is almost always determined by the DM (see the critical failure charts in the optional rules section). 


#### Advantage and Disadvantage
Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage. When that happens, you roll a second die when you make the check. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.

If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, each source counts separately, and the total number of advantage rolls is compared to the total number of disadvantage rolls.  If there are equal number of advantage and disadvantage rolls, then the creature is considered to have neither advantage nor disadvantage and rolls normally.  If there are more than one type (i.e. advantage or disadvantage) compared to the other type, then the creature is considered to either have advantage or disadvantage depending on which one has more sources.  If the number of sources of one type exceeds the other by more than one, then the creature gains a special circumstantial bonus or penalty to their ability or skill value for the purposes of this check (to a maximum of +3).  

There are two mechanics to 

# 0.2 Game Terms

### Abilities

Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:

- **Strength**, measuring physical power
- **Dexterity**, measuring agility
- **Constitution**, measuring endurance
- **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory
- **Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight
- **Charisma**, measuring force of personality

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature's assets as well as weaknesses.

The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. 

More detail can be found in section 1.1 Rolling Ability Scores.  CONTINUE LINK!


### Saving Throws
A saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don't normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character is at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. Each saving throw is associated with a particular cluster of effects, and an attribute that modifies that save.  

The types of saves, and the attributes that modify them, are as follows:

- **Brute Force (Strength)**: Use this saving throw to resist brute force effects that would move or restrain you. Modified by Strength. 
- **Death, Poison, or Disease (Constitution)**: The saving throw against attacks that severely test fortitude. Modified by Constitution.   
- **Paralysis, Petrify, or Polymorph (Constitution)**: The saving throw against restrictions on movement and transformations. Modified by Constitution. 
- **Wands, Devices, or Traps (Dexterity)**: The saving throw against sudden or aimed attacks that need to be dodged. Modified by Dexterity.
- **Blast, or Breath (Dexterity)**: The saving throw against area, cloud, and cone attacks that must be dodged. Modified by Dexterity.
- **Illusions (Intelligence)**: The saving throw against attacks that test perception. Modified by Intelligence. 
- **Enchantment (Wisdom)**: The saving throw against attacks the mind directly, including manipulative and most mind-affecting spells. Modified by Wisdom. 
- **Fear, or Mind Control (Charisma)**: The saving throw against attacks that test willpower, such as terrifying and sanity-blasting situations and spells that overtake or control the mind. Modified by Charisma. 


A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Enchantment and Mind Control saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to the relevant saving throws. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is typically determined by the caster's spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.

## ABILITIES
Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:

- **Strength**, measuring physical power
- **Dexterity**, measuring agility
- **Constitution**, measuring endurance
- **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory
- **Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight
- **Charisma**, measuring force of personality

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature's assets as well as weaknesses.

The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The book's introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.

## Ability Scores and Modifiers

Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. 

A score of 9, 10, or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and greater beings can have scores as high as 30.

## Using Each Ability

Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.

### Strength

Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.


**Table: Strength Modifiers**

| Score  | Combat Checks | Feats of Strength | EV |   
|:-----|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| 3 |-4 | -3 | ^ |
| 4 |-3 | -2 | ^ |
| 5 |-3 | -2 | +5 |
| 6 |-2 | -1 | +6 |
| 7 |-2 | -1 | +7 |
| 8 |-1 | -1 | +8 |
| 9 |-1 | 0 | +9 |
| 10 |0 | 0 | +10 |
| 11 |0 | 0 | +11 |
| 12 |+1 | +1 | +12 |
| 13 |+1 | +1 | +13|
| 14 |+2 | +1 | +14 |
| 15 |+2 | +2 | +15 |
| 16 |+3 | +2 | +16 |
| 17 |+3 | +3 | +17 |
| 18 |+4 | +3 | +18 |
| 19 |+4 | +4 | +19 |
| 20 |+5 | +4 | +20 |
| 21 |+5 | +5 | +21 |
| 22 |+6 | +6 | +22 |
| 23 |+6 | +6 | +23 |

| 25 |+7 | +8 | +25 |
| 26 |+8 | +8 | +26 |
| 27 |+8 |+9 | +27 |
| 28 |+9 |+10 | +28 |
| 29 |+9 |+10 | +29 |
| 30 |+10 |+11 | +30 |


**Score**: This is the numerical representation of your strength.  

**Combat Checks**: This is the value added (or subtracted) to attempts at combat checks involving strength.  performing feats of strength, melee and thrown attack and damage rolls, and strength based skills and saving throws.   

**EV**: EV stands for Encumbrance Value. Strength strongly modifies how much equipment a character can lug around. Strength values with a caret (^) can only carry up to their strength value in EV before becoming heavily encumbered, and even then they are considered moderately encumbered. They are only unencumbered when weighed down by no gear. In this case, constitution modifiers are ignored.  



#### Feats of Strength

Also called a Strength check, a feat of strength covers any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. A strength check is modified by the strength modifier column above.  

The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
- Break free of bonds
- Push through a tunnel that is too small
- Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it
- Tip over a statue
- Keep a boulder from rolling

#### Attack Rolls and Damage

You add your character's Strength modifier to attack rolls and your damage rolls when attacking with a non-finesse weapon, which includes most melee weapons and some ranged weapons.

#### Encumbrance
Your character's Strength (and, to a lesser degree, constitution) score determines how much weight may be carried by your character. See the Encumbrance section CONTINUE for details on the effects of weight carried upon a character's movement and actions.

#### Saving Throws

Strength modifies the following saving throws (see section CONTINUE for more details): 
- Brute Force


#### Skill Rolls

Strength modifies the following skills (see section CONTINUE for more details): 
- Athletics 
- Blacksmithing
- Carpentry

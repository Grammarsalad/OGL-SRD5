# 0.0 What is Old School Pulp Cthulhu?

## What is Pulp Cthulhu 
Pulp Cthulhu, as I define it, is characterized by Cthulhuesque themes with high fantasy characteristics.  Reality as we know it is an illusion, a pocket of sanity in a universe given to unfathomable chaos, nihilism, and entropy.  The 'gods', such as they are, are either non-existent, malevolent or blind primal forces, or, perhaps, a manifestation of popular belief.  This illusion serves as a kind of protective, however, as knowledge of the truth of reality strains, and often breaks, the mind.  Most people do not want to know the truth, and actively work to suppress it.  The reasons why they do this are myriad, but it is often a subconscious defense mechanism designed to protect their sanity.  

The heroes of the story, on the other hand, are a cut above the rest. They know or have better insight into the true nature of reality, and they have better defenses against the terrors that hide just beneath the veneer.  

## What is Old School Role-Playing? 
In this context, an 'old school' RPG is any rpg that tries to capture the secret mix found in the original versions of the first and finest rpg.  This game makes heavy use of the ogl rules found in the 5th edition, but makes changes in order to recapture the best of both worlds.

### Abilities

Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:

- **Strength**, measuring physical power
- **Dexterity**, measuring agility
- **Constitution**, measuring endurance
- **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory
- **Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight
- **Charisma**, measuring force of personality

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature's assets as well as weaknesses.

The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. 

More detail can be found in section 1.1 Rolling Ability Scores.  CONTINUE LINK!


### Saving Throws
A saving throw-also called a save-represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don't normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character is at risk of harm.

To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. Each saving throw is associated with a particular cluster of effects, and an attribute that modifies that save.  

The types of saves, and the attributes that modify them, are as follows:

- **Brute Force (Strength)**: Use this saving throw to resist brute force effects that would move or restrain you. Modified by Strength. 
- **Death, Poison, or Disease (Constitution)**: The saving throw against attacks that severely test fortitude. Modified by Constitution.   
- **Paralysis, Petrify, or Polymorph (Constitution)**: The saving throw against restrictions on movement and transformations. Modified by Constitution. 
- **Wands, Devices, or Traps (Dexterity)**: The saving throw against sudden or aimed attacks that need to be dodged. Modified by Dexterity.
- **Blast, or Breath (Dexterity)**: The saving throw against area, cloud, and cone attacks that must be dodged. Modified by Dexterity.
- **Illusions (Intelligence)**: The saving throw against attacks that test perception. Modified by Intelligence. 
- **Enchantment (Wisdom)**: The saving throw against attacks the mind directly, including manipulative and most mind-affecting spells. Modified by Wisdom. 
- **Fear, or Mind Control (Charisma)**: The saving throw against attacks that test willpower, such as terrifying and sanity-blasting situations and spells that overtake or control the mind. Modified by Charisma. 


A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.

Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Enchantment and Mind Control saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to the relevant saving throws. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.

The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is typically determined by the caster's spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus.

The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect.

## ABILITIES
Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:

- **Strength**, measuring physical power
- **Dexterity**, measuring agility
- **Constitution**, measuring endurance
- **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory
- **Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight
- **Charisma**, measuring force of personality

Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature's assets as well as weaknesses.

The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The book's introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.

## Ability Scores and Modifiers

Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. 

A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, or even 22 in some cases, and monsters and greater beings can have scores as high as 30.

## Using Each Ability

Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.

### Strength

Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.

#### Strength Checks

A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.

***Athletics***. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:

- You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.
- You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.
- You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.

***Other Strength Checks***. The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

- Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door
- Break free of bonds
- Push through a tunnel that is too small
- Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it
- Tip over a statue
- Keep a boulder from rolling

#### Attack Rolls and Damage

You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.

#### Lifting and Carrying

Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.

***Carrying Capacity***. Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.

***Push, Drag, or Lift***. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.

***Size and Strength***. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.
